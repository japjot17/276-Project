## Abstract

“PERSONGIFY” is an online web application allowing the user to generate their own personalized playlists using the Spotify API. Some additional features will require the Google Maps API and the Facebook/Instagram API.

## Why PERSONGIFY?

Spotify has a vast library of songs, yet it rarely offers personally generated playlists. When it does, given playlists are often structured around specific themes. For example, “Your Summer Rewind” is a personal playlist featuring a user’s old summer favorites. Other examples include, “Your Time Capsule”, a playlist compiling a user’s old favorites, or “Discover Weekly”, a playlist of recommendations based on a user’s recent listening history. While these playlists can be nice, it often leaves the user at the company’s whim of what personal playlists are generated and when.

The lack of personalized playlists is further exacerbated by the fact that users may find it difficult to discover new songs that fit their current taste, mood, or even preferences. Currently, there are pre-made playlists that users can browse by genre, as well as those crafted by the community. Still, they lack a sense of a personal touch.

PERSONGIFY’s goal is to put more control into the users hands and let them dynamically build a playlist based on their own terms.

## Example User Stories:

A user would like to generate a new playlist for their mundane commute to school and wants to tune the songs to fit their parameters. This includes playlist length, mood, favorite artists, genre, and more. Since the user (a student) only wants to listen to music during the commute, they enter in their current location (home) and destination (school). PERSONGIFY will then aim to generate a playlist consisting of the user’s preferred songs, with the total playlist length set to the travel time.

On the other hand, another user would like a summary of their listening statistics displaying their most frequent artists and songs (similar to Spotify Wrapped, a once-a-year Spotify feature). PERSONGIFY will present a slideshow of infographics to the user, summarizing the user's top 5 artists, tracks, genres, podcasts, and moods. Then, PERSONGIFY will generate a playlist containing the user's top 100 songs over the past year. At the end of the presentation, PERSONGIFY will allow users to download the infographics and share them on common social medias, such as Facebook and Instagram.

Over time, both these users will have access to PERSONGIFY’s “Like” system. If the users enjoy listening to a certain song, they can Like the songs so PERSONGIFY can remember their preferences. This way, PERSONGIFY can continue to recommend songs the users will love. This will even change the users’ homepage, where they will see songs closely related to their tastes, alongside the music playlists they have generated.

## Who Is PERSONGIFY For?

This personalized music assistant is made for Spotify users who want to explore their music tastes and diversify their music knowledge. Whether on the go or chilling at home, PERSONGIFY will create a custom playlist to fit your needs.
